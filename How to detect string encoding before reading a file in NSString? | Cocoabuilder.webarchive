TextEdit's encoding guesser just uses the built-in NSAttributedString method -initWithURL:options:documentAttributes:error:, which will guess the file's encoding when opening it. But it has been mentioned that heuristics are not infallible, and this method's heuristics are no exception. It does a good job overall, but I've found that it usually misinterprets UTF-8 format text.<br>

Yes, I know that all the guess jobs can fail. I was starting to be excited when started reading your reply but if it usually misinterprets UTF-8, that's a pretty significant problem...<br>

That was a long time ago, so it may have been fixed. But if it's still happening, then one workaround would be to try and open the file as UTF-8 first, and if that fails, then fall back on the above method. The UTF-8 parser often returns nil on text that is not in UTF-8 format IIRC.<br>

I have an app that collects a lot of text off the web; my string creation algorithm is something like the following:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp; Attempt to create an NSString with NSUTF8StringEncoding.<br>
2.&nbsp; If the string is nil, attempt to create the string using the encoding returned from the server.<br>
3.&nbsp; If string is still nil, ask the Text Encoding Conversion Manager to sniff out the encoding from the data.<br>

 3b.&nbsp; Attempt to create a string with the encoding.<br>

There was a little too much code associated with this to copy/paste into email, but I'd be happy to share... I have a wrapper object for the needed interaction with the Text Encoding Conversion Manager.&nbsp; Some more about it:<br>

You might not have to guess at all, if the file has an xattr of<br>
"com.apple.TextEncoding" attached to it.&nbsp; I don't know if any of the<br>
NSString encoding-guessing methods use this xattr or not.&nbsp; It's easy<br>
to test, though: TextEdit.app writes the xattr when you Save As and<br>
choose an encoding.<br>
<br>
The contents of the xattr is a text-encoding name (such as "utf-8"),<br>
then a semicolon, then a longish decimal number.<br>
<br>
You can see a file's xattrs with the xattr command in Terminal.&nbsp; Type<br>
'xattr -h' for a summary of options and args.&nbsp; The xattr API works<br>
great in C (BSD functions, exist since OS 10.4 Tiger).<br>
<br>
Google search terms:<br>
xattr site:developer.apple.com<br>

&gt;&gt; That was a long time ago, so it may have been fixed. But if it's still happening, then one workaround would be to try and open the file as UTF-8 first, and if that fails, then fall back on the above method. The UTF-8 parser often returns nil on text that is not in UTF-8 format IIRC.<br>

I finally got around building a little test program and I tried a few files that were sent to me by a coworker from a Windows machine compressed into a zip archive. I did unarchive the files and fed them to my test program. All of them failed mightily. Just a bunch symbols showing clearly that the framework cannot guess the encoding. Each file had a specific encoding but each time, it guessed the encoding as NSMacOSRomanStringEncoding which is plainly wrong. I tried opening the files in TextEdit and they show up the same way, wrong encoding.<br>
<br>
Looks like I'll have to look for other suggested alternatives‚Ä¶.<br>

Not sure if you read my last email on the topic but using the NSAttributedString initWithURL:encoding:documentAttributes: is failing. I have read a bit about the Text Conversion Manager but if you had already some code you could share, that would spare me reinventing the wheel!<br>

Certainly.&nbsp; I've zipped up two classes that wrap some functionality from the Text Conversion Manager functions.&nbsp; I'm certain I got these from somewhere else years ago, but failed to find them now.&nbsp; Download at:<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.positivespinmedia.com/dev/TEC.zip">http://www.positivespinmedia.com/dev/TEC.zip</a><br>
<br>
Usage looks something like this:<br>

 NSInteger i = 0;<br>
 NSString *myResultantString = nil;<br>
 TECSniffer *sniffer = [[TECSniffer alloc] initWithWebTextEncodings];<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; NSArray *results = [sniffer sniff:yourNSDataObjectGoesHere];<br>

 // ideally, you've got a legitimate NSString object when the above is finished<br>

If memory serves, you'll need to link CoreServices into your app to use TEC.&nbsp; Hope this helps!<br>
